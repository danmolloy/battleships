# Battleships

## Rules
Upon clicking Start, the boards are both rendered with following ships (the bracketed number is the number of squares long it is):

1 x Carrier (5)
1 x Battleship (4)
1 x Destroyer (3)
1 x Submarine (3)
1 x Patrol Boat (2)

The ships may be horizontal or vertical. They cannot be touching another ship (including a diagonal square).

Player can see their ships which the CPU is attacking (represented with 'â€¢' on the 'Player Ships' board). However, like the classic rules, the player cannot see the ships they are attacking (on the 'CPU Ships' board). 

'X' represents a hit, whereas 'O' is a miss. 

## CPU turns
The CPU is unaware of where the player's ships are set. It will take random shots until it hits a ship. At this point, it will log where that square is. Just like a human player, it will try the squares in various directions until it learns the direction the ship is sitting. Once again, just like a human player, the CPU is notified when the ship under attack sinks and reverts to random attacks. 

There is a small interval before CPU makes a turn to make it seem more authentic.

## Features
Like many games, a player can view the highscores of past players.

There is a small amount of useful information for the player to peruse while playing, i.e. the ships remaining and number of attacks taken.

## Stack:
- React
- Redux
- Tailwind
- Jest
- TypeScript
- Mirage.js
- Create React App

In planning this game, it quickly became apparent that it would be easiest to handle state with redux. I divided the state into three categories:
* Game: handles who's turn it is, whether game is in play and highscores
* CPU board: handles setting CPU ship's, handling player's moves and their progress in game (number of moves made, ships remaining).
* Player board: handles setting Player ships, CPU attack logic and the CPU progress in game.

I initially had considered minimizing code by combining CPU and Player board slices, but decided the more verbose approach brings clarity. 

The highscores a fetched from a mock backend created with Miragejs. I felt it a nice touch to what would otherwise be a purely frontend project.

The project is my first with TypeScript. As one will see, I'm still getting familiar with it. I'm following the handbook's suggestion of initially seeing how little I need, although I may have taken this advice too far!

I used tailwind for the styling, which I chose to keep as minimal as possible.
